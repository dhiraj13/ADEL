# Important dates
For the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, the IOC's anti-doping rules and procedures are in force starting 18 April 2024, in addition to the existing IF and NADO anti-doping rules that athletes and coaches are bound by.

## 18 April - 17 July 2024
**Pre-Games period**
- This starts on 18 April 2024 until 17 July 2024 (one day before the opening of the Olympic Village). 
- During this period, the International Testing Agency (ITA) can test athletes, on behalf of the IOC.

## 18 July 2024
**Opening of the Olympic Village**
The Olympic Village opens on 18 July 2024

## 18 July - 11 August 2024
**Period of the Games**
This starts on 18 July 2024 with the opening of the Olympic Village until 11 August 2024, the day of the Closing Ceremony.

# In-competition and out-of-competition period
Athletes need to be able to determine whether a period is considered in-competition or out-of-competition. Some substances are only banned in-competition and others are banned at all times. It does not matter when you take a substance. If the substance is banned in-competition and is found in your sample (collected in-competition), you may be sanctioned, even if you took the substance out-of-competition.

## IN-COMPETITION PERIOD
Typically, the in-competition period begins at 11:59 pm the day before any competition an athlete is scheduled to compete in, up to and until the end of the competition and all testing associated with that competition.

Two summer Olympic IFs - the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and International Equestrian Federation (FEI) - use a different definition for the in-competition period. This definition, approved by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), is the same for all of their competitions. Please check with your IF if you are not familiar with their definition.

## OUT-OF-COMPETITION PERIOD
Any period not in-competition. This means at all other times.

# Who's who during the Games?
Athletes may be used to their National Anti-Doping Organization (NADO) and/or International Federation (IF) being the face of anti-doping to them. During the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, these roles may be carried out by other Anti-Doping Organizations (ADOs).

## International Olympic Committee
The IOC is the testing authority during the Games as they are the Major Event Organizer (MEO) – so anyone coming to the Games is bound by the IOC’s anti-doping rules.

The IOC has agreed to delegate its anti-doping responsibilities in relation to the Olympic Games to the International Testing Agency (ITA).

## International Testing Agency (ITA)
Amongst its delegated activities during the Games, the ITA:
- Conducts testing activities
- Manages the Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) process and TUE Committee (TUEC)
- Undertakes results management

## The Anti-Doping Division of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS ADD)
- Conducts hearings and makes decision on any case involving an Anti-Doping Rule Violation (ADRV) including disqualification of results or ineligibility for the Games
- Manages cases in an expedited way during the Games. This means cases will be dealt with quickly
- Is fair and impartial
- International Federations (IFs) are responsible for deciding any period of ineligibility beyond the period of the Games. IFs may choose to delegate this responsibility to CAS
