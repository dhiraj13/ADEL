# 1. First things first
## Important dates
For the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, the IOC's anti-doping rules and procedures are in force starting 18 April 2024, in addition to the existing IF and NADO anti-doping rules that athletes and coaches are bound by.

### 18 April - 17 July 2024
**Pre-Games period**
- This starts on 18 April 2024 until 17 July 2024 (one day before the opening of the Olympic Village). 
- During this period, the International Testing Agency (ITA) can test athletes, on behalf of the IOC.

### 18 July 2024
**Opening of the Olympic Village**
The Olympic Village opens on 18 July 2024

### 18 July - 11 August 2024
**Period of the Games**
This starts on 18 July 2024 with the opening of the Olympic Village until 11 August 2024, the day of the Closing Ceremony.

## In-competition and out-of-competition period
Athletes need to be able to determine whether a period is considered in-competition or out-of-competition. Some substances are only banned in-competition and others are banned at all times. It does not matter when you take a substance. If the substance is banned in-competition and is found in your sample (collected in-competition), you may be sanctioned, even if you took the substance out-of-competition.

### IN-COMPETITION PERIOD
Typically, the in-competition period begins at 11:59 pm the day before any competition an athlete is scheduled to compete in, up to and until the end of the competition and all testing associated with that competition.

Two summer Olympic IFs - the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and International Equestrian Federation (FEI) - use a different definition for the in-competition period. This definition, approved by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), is the same for all of their competitions. Please check with your IF if you are not familiar with their definition.

### OUT-OF-COMPETITION PERIOD
Any period not in-competition. This means at all other times.

## Who's who during the Games?
Athletes may be used to their National Anti-Doping Organization (NADO) and/or International Federation (IF) being the face of anti-doping to them. During the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, these roles may be carried out by other Anti-Doping Organizations (ADOs).

### International Olympic Committee
The IOC is the testing authority during the Games as they are the Major Event Organizer (MEO) – so anyone coming to the Games is bound by the IOC’s anti-doping rules.

The IOC has agreed to delegate its anti-doping responsibilities in relation to the Olympic Games to the International Testing Agency (ITA).

### International Testing Agency (ITA)
Amongst its delegated activities during the Games, the ITA:
- Conducts testing activities
- Manages the Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) process and TUE Committee (TUEC)
- Undertakes results management

### The Anti-Doping Division of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS ADD)
- Conducts hearings and makes decision on any case involving an Anti-Doping Rule Violation (ADRV) including disqualification of results or ineligibility for the Games
- Manages cases in an expedited way during the Games. This means cases will be dealt with quickly
- Is fair and impartial
- International Federations (IFs) are responsible for deciding any period of ineligibility beyond the period of the Games. IFs may choose to delegate this responsibility to CAS

# 2. Your Responsibilities
You have now been through the roles and responsibilities that different organizations have during the Games.  In the same way, athletes and athlete support personnel have roles and responsibilities too.

## Learning objectives
At the end of this module you should be able to:
- Explain the 11 Anti-Doping Rule Violations (ADRVs)
- Understand the principle of strict liability
- Know how to check which substances and methods are banned in sport
- Check the status of medications
- Apply for a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) and have an existing TUE recognized
- Provide the necessary Whereabouts information

## Anti-Doping Rule Violations (ADRVs)
ADRVs are not just because of a positive test.
There are 11 ADRVs. Click on the + icons below to learn more:
1. Presence [Testing positive (bloode or urine)].
2. Use or attempted use. [Evidence of using, or tryint to use a banned substance or method such as from a suspicious biological passport.]
3. Evading, refusing, or failure [Hiding from the Doping Control Officer (DCO), refusing to be tested, or not going to the Doping Control Station.]
4. Whereabouts failures [Athletes not being where they say they will be or missing a test during their 60-minute time slot, not submitting Whereabouts on time, or submitting incomplete or wrong information.]
5. Tempering [Interfering with the testing or doping control process, including during the prosecution of a case.]
6. Possession of aprohibited substance or method [What the Code says: It is a potential ADRV if an athlete or athlete support personnel is in possession of a prohibited substance or method without a justifiable reason (for example an athlete has a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) for the substance).]
7. Trafficking [Handling, transporting, selling or attempting to sell banned substances.]
8. Administering to an athlete. [Giving or trying to give a banned substance to an athlete.]
9. Complicity or Attempted Complicity [Helping someone to dope or helping to cover up doping.]
10. Prohibited Association [Working with or seeking help/services from someone who is serving a period of ineligibility. A list of suspended athlete support personnel is available on the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA's) website.]
11. Retaliate against anyone who shares information about doping [Actions that frighten someone from reporting suspected doping, or acts of revenge against those who have reported.]

All ADRVs apply to athletes, and 7 apply to athlete support personnel, such as coaches.

## What are the 7 ADRV that apply to athlete support personnel?
1. Possession
2. Tempering
3. Trafficking
4. Administration to an athlete
5. Complicity
6. Prohibited Association
7. Retaliation against anyone who shares information about doping

## Strict Liability
Athletes are responsible for their performance during a competition. In the same way, athletes are responsible for any substance that is found in their body.

### The principle of strict liability
Athletes are responsible for any banned substance they use or attempt to use, or that is found in their body, regardless of how the substance got there or whether they had an intention to cheat.

So, athletes need to know which substances and methods are banned in sport and how to protect themselves.

### Know how to check which substances and methods are banned in sport

Banned substances and methods are included in the Prohibited List(opens in a new tab) (List). This List applies during the Games and at all times. The List contains substances and methods that are:
- Banned at all times (both in-competition and out-of-competition)
- Banned in-competition only
- Banned in specific sports (archery, golf and shooting)
- Conditional – athletes are allowed to take up to a specific dose or within a specific dosage range but outside of that dose or range it is banned (for example, some ingredients found in asthma inhalers). Other conditional substances are ones that are only banned by the way they are taken (route of administration) (for example, applied as a cream, or swallowed, or inhaled).

### Prohibited List updates
The Prohibited List is updated every year. The List updates are published on WADA's website(opens in a new tab) on 1 October of each year and the update comes into effect on 1 January of the following year. 

The 2024 Prohibited List will be the version in force for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. The 2024 List will be published on WADA's website by 1 October 2023 and will come into force on 1 January 2024. It is very important that athletes and their support personnel consult the correct version of the List and (opens in a new tab)are aware of any changes.

### Don't forget!
The 2023 List is in effect ONLY until 31 December 2023. On 1 January 2024 a new List comes into effect!

## Top Tip
Set a calendar reminder to check for the List update in October and one for 1 January when the revised List comes into effect.

## Here are some important things you need to remember:
1. An athlete's medication may contain a banned substance. Before using any medication, seek medical advice and check the medication. 

The status of medication purchased IN FRANCE should be checked on the Agence Française de Lutte contre le Dopage (AFLD) website(opens in a new tab) (available in French only) and not your home country's database as the ingredients may be different in the two countries.

As a reminder, WADA does not check the accuracy of each national database, therefore it is always best to also check with a medical professional before taking any medication.

2. It doesn’t matter when a substance is taken. If a substance banned only in-competition is taken out-of-competition, it can still result in a positive test if it is still in the athlete's system and they are selected for an in-competition test.

3. Review the relevant customs advice for any medication brought from a home country into France. This information is also usually provided in the Customs and Freight Guide which is distributed by the Games Organizing Committee. If you are unsure, ask your National Olympic Committee (NOC). 

Don't forget, you should disclose any medication that you are taking to your team doctor so that they can advise you.

## Let's discuss supplements
There are risks associated with supplement use.
Supplements can
- Contain a banned substance
- Be contaminated with a banned substance during the manufacturing process
- Contain ingredients that are named differently to how they appear on the List
- Make false claims such as "approved by WADA" or "safe for athletes"
- Exclude some ingredients from their labels
- Be sold as fake products over the internet

1. Athletes need to ensure that they fully understand the risks associated with supplement use and how to minimize these risks
2. Supplements that are not batch-tested increase the risk of inadvertent doping
3. Athletes must undertake thorough research before using a supplement

### If you use a supplement...
- Keep a small amount - if you test positive, you at least have the option of having your leftover sample scientifically tested to see if it was contaminated
- Keep the batch-test certificate - if you do take a supplement, lower your risk by choosing a batch-tested product
- Keep the proof of purchase, like a receipt
- Keep a log of when and how much you take

## What happens if an athlete needs to use a medication or be treated using a method that is on the Prohibited List?
An athlete's health is important.

An athlete who, for legitimate medical reasons, needs to use a medication that contains a banned substance or use a banned method may be able to do so.

Under certain conditions and specific criteria (including if there are no suitable alternatives) an athlete may be granted a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE). 

A TUE ensures that athletes can be treated for medical conditions even if the treatment involves using a prohibited substance or method, while avoiding the risk of being sanctioned. A TUE is granted for:
- A diagnosed medical condition
- A set period of time
- A set dose and frequency of use
- A set route of administration

# 3. Doping Control at the Games
Testing is in place to protect athletes, your hard work and the integrity of sport.
It is important for athletes to know and understand the testing process and what your rights and responsibilities are.
## Who can test athletes at the Games?
Only organizations who have authority can test athletes
1. International Testing Agency (ITA) [The ITA can conduct in-competition and out-of-competition testing during the period of the Games.]
2. Anti-Doping Organizations (ADOs) with testing authority [ADOs with testing authority over athletes can test outside the event venues - in cordination with, and subject to approval from the ITA.]
3. World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) [WADA has authority to test in exceptional circumstances.]

## Remember!
Testing can take place **ANY TIME** and at **ANY PLACE**

## Doping control at the Games
When athletes are selected for doping control (testing), they will go through the following process:
Testing process: Athlete selection, athlete notification, reporting to the doping control station, providing a sample(s), review and sign Doping Control Form (DCF)

## Athlete Notification
A chaperone or Doping Control Officer (DCO) will notify the athlete that they have been selected for doping control. The chaperone or DCO will ask to see the athlete's accreditation. The chaperone and DCO will also have accreditations.
The chaperone or DCO will then explain the athlete’s rights and responsibilities.
### Athletes have the right to:
- Have a representative present
- Ask for an interpreter
- Ask questions about the sample collection process
- Ask for modifications
- Ask for a delay in reporting to the doping control station for a valid reason

### Athletes have the responsibility to:
- Stay within direct observation of the DCO/chaperone at all times from the point of notification until the end of the sample collection process
- Show valid identification (accreditation)
- Respect the sample collection procedures (failure to do so may constitute an Anti-Doping Rule Violation (ADRV)
- Report immediately for sample collection, unless there are valid reasons for a delay

## What are the valid reasons to request a delay?
### For out-of-competition testing:
- Locating a representative or interpreter
- Completing a training session
- Receiving medical treatment
- Obtaining photo identification

### For in-competition testing:
- Participating in a medal ceremony
- Fulfilling media commitments (i.e. attending press conferences, giving an interview etc.)
- Competing in additional competitions
- Having a cool down session
- Obtaining necessary medical treatment
- Locating a representative and/ or interpreter
- Obtaining photo identification (accreditation)

## Reporting to the Doping Control Station

Athletes will be asked to provide a urine and/or blood sample.

### For urine sample collection
- Athletes will choose a sample collection vessel – make sure that it is sealed and intact.
- A DCO who is the same gender as the athlete will witness the sample being provided.
- Athletes will choose a sample collection kit - make sure that it is sealed, intact and that the numbers (codes) are the same on both bottles.
- Athletes will divide the urine sample into “A” and “B” bottles and seal them.
- Athletes will review the information on the Doping Control Form (DCF) and add in some detail such as the name of their coach, the medications and supplements they have taken in the last 7 day - a copy will be sent to their email address.

### For blood sample collection
- Blood will be collected by a Blood Control Officer (BCO) who is trained in taking blood and has adequate qualifications.
- Athletes will choose a blood sample collection kit - make sure that it is sealed, intact and that the numbers on all vials are the same.
- Athletes need to be seated for 10 minutes (at rest) before blood can be taken.
- When an Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) blood test is collected, athletes must not have competed or trained in the two hours prior. So, an athlete may need chaperoning for an extended period of time if they have recently been active.

### Dried Blood Spot (DBS) sample collection
During the Olympic Games, DBS samples may also be collected.

DBS is a method that collects a few drops of blood by pricking athlete's fingertip. The drops are placed into special filter paper cards to be analyzed in WADA-accredited laboratories.

A DCO or BCO who is trained in taking capillary blood samples and has adequate qualifications will collect the sample.

### Remember!
If there are any concerns about the doping control process, write them down on the DCF or on a supplementary report form.

## Doping control steps in order
1. The athlete is selected for testing
2. The chaperone or DCO notifies the athlete of their selection
3. The athlete reports directly to the doping control station
4. The athlete provides a urine and/ or blood sample
5. The athlete reviews and signs the DCF

## What happens after the test?
- Samples will be sent to a WADA accredited laboratory confidentially, this means they do not know the athlete's name or nationality - just the sample number
- The A sample is opened and analyzed
- If the A sample is negative, it is the end of the process
- Samples can be stored for up to 10 years and can be further analyzed
- The B sample is securely stored

### If the A sample tests positive
- The ITA will notify the athlete and state the date, time and place for the opening of the B sample if requested by the athlete
- The athlete can choose not to have the B sample analyzed
- The athlete and/or their representative should have the opportunity to attend the B sample opening
- The athlete can also waive their right to be present during the opening of the B sample

### If the B sample tests positive
- If the B sample confirms the finding of the A sample, or if the athlete decides not to have the B sample analyzed, the finding of the A sample is considered an alleged ADRV

## Consequences
Anyone committing an ADRV knows they may face a ban from sport. But there are other consequences too.
- Disqualification of competition results
- Exclusion and loss of accreditation from the Games
- Loss of all medals, points, prizes
- Target testing and possible investigations of the team in a team sport
- In some cases, loss of points, disqualification from a competition or from the entire Games for the team
- Athlete support personnel may be investigated, and if the athlete is a minor then an investigation is mandatory

### Remember!
It only takes one athlete in a team sport/event to test positive for the consequences to impact the entire team such as, losing medals or even disqualification. Team sports include basketball, rugby etc., and team events include 4x400m relay, team competitions, etc.

## An ADRV goes well beyond the individual athlete or athlete support personnel.
- It has an impact on those who have been supporting athletes all the way: Family, friends, teammates, sponsors, etc.
- An athlete's reputation as well as their country and sport's reputations are affected.
- An athlete's physical and mental health could be at risk.

## Speaking up
Everyone has a duty to protect clean sport.

Taking part in clean sport requires those involved in sport to speak up when they suspect doping.

If athletes or coaches suspect, witness, or know of an activity that goes against clean sport, it is their responsibility to report it.  There are different ways to report and share information to protect clean sport.

### Reveal - ITA's reporting platform
REVEAL(opens in a new tab) is the International Testing Agency’s (ITA) platform that enables you to report what you have seen, heard or experienced in a completely anonymous and secure manner – during the Olympic Games or at any other time. 

All information is treated as important in a confidential and sensible manner.

### Speak Up - WADA's reporting platform
WADA's Speak Up(opens in a new tab) platform allows the reporting of any information about an individual or organization in a strictly confidential way.

You can report suspected doping - any Anti-Doping Rule Violation (ADRV) or any act or omission that could go against clean sport.

Many National Anti-Doping Organizations (NADOs) and International Federations (IFs) provide a way to share information.  Contact them or visit their website to find out if they have any tools to share concerns about clean sport and report doping.

## Final word
1. Ingredients in similar brands of medicine can vary among countries.
  - Even over the counter medication for colds and headaches can contain banned substances.
  - Before taking any medication, check the ingredients and ask a doctor or go to the Polyclinic.
2. We understand athletes may want to celebrate when they’ve finished competing!
  - Celebratory activities should not risk an athlete's health, medals, prizes, or their reputation.
  - Remember, athletes can be tested any time during the Games, even if they’ve finished their events!
